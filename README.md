## What is True Guilded?
True Guilded is a ReGuilded theme that has the goal of making Guilded, truly... Guilded! Looking just like the Twitter concept art, I hope you guys fall in love with this masterpiece.

## What do we change?
Our theme makes minor changes to Guilded in order to keep it more inline to the [@TeamGuilded](https://twitter.com/teamguilded) concept art. Below is a list of what we change.
- Hovering over events will now scale that box
- Message highlights are now distanced
- Selected channels have a linear blue hover
- Most of the UI now has a 10px rounded corner
- Action menus are cleaner
- Bots in the settings menu are cleaner and distanced
